###Description

Can you find after how many years will a person's birthday fall on the same day of the week that he was born?

###Example
For example, Joy's birthday is on 16th October, 1990 which falls on Friday. After how many years will his birthday fall on Friday again? (That would be 11 years)
```
next_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(1990, 10, 16)) # 11
next_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(2012, 5, 20))  # 6
next_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(1975, 2, 22))  # 5```
